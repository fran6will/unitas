## Note

Unitas is a theoretical model designed to invite collective reflection on the concept and essence of religion. It aims to explore how a new spiritual and community framework can address modern needs for inclusivity and connection without the constraints of traditional religious structures.

## Fundamental Principles

Unitas is built on several essential pillars:
- **Unity and Equality:** All human beings are equal and must be treated with respect and dignity. Unitas seeks to create an environment where every individual is valued and diversity is celebrated.

- **Freedom of Conscience:** Everyone is free to follow their own spiritual and moral convictions, as long as it does not harm others. This freedom is fundamental to allow each person to find their own spiritual path.

- **Diversity and Inclusion:** Diversity is valued and integrated into all practices and decisions. Unitas recognizes the richness that the diversity of experiences and beliefs brings to the community.

- **Transparency and Participation:** Decision-making processes must be transparent and inclusive, allowing open participation from all members. Every voice counts, and every decision is made collectively.

- **Kindness and Non-violence:** All members must act with kindness and compassion towards others, contributing to a harmonious community. All forms of violence, physical or verbal, are prohibited.

- **Environmental Responsibility:** Members must act respectfully towards the environment by adopting sustainable practices and minimizing their ecological impact. Protecting the Earth is a priority.

- **Education and Knowledge Sharing:** Education is a right for all, and members must commit to sharing their knowledge and skills for the benefit of the community. Collective growth is encouraged.

- **Arts:** The arts are valued as a means of spiritual connection, personal expression, and healing. Members are encouraged to engage in artistic activities to explore and share their spirituality.

- **Humor and Self-irony:** Humor and self-irony are essential for maintaining spiritual and emotional balance. Every idea and action within the community must include a dose of lightness and laughter.

- **Spiritual Polarity (Contemplation and Action):** Members must balance spiritual contemplation with benevolent actions for the collective good. Regular moments for meditation and connecting to the Source of Life are essential.

- **Spiritual Reflection:** Members must make an effort to read and understand technologies and the evolution of science in their local environment to stay ahead in their reflections. Knowing and anticipating changes allows better adaptation.

- **Evolution and Adaptation:** The religion evolves over time, adopting new ideas and technologies to remain relevant and accessible to all. All laws are designed to evolve and adapt to contemporary realities through a process of collective consultation.
