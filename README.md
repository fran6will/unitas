# Unitas: A New Spiritual and Community Platform

## Introduction

**Religare (to bind):** Cicero suggested that "religion" derives from "religare," meaning "to bind." This implies connecting humans to divinity or spiritual values.

In response to the rejection of traditional religions by younger generations, Unitas aims to bridge the gap between the rise of individual spirituality and the decline of traditional spiritual systems. By offering a framework without clergy or institutional dominance, Unitas seeks to revive the positive aspects of religion in a new structure, addressing modern needs for less dogmatic and more inclusive spirituality.

## What We Believe

Unitas is a spiritual and community movement dedicated to unity, inclusion, and collective growth. We believe in a higher force currently named Source of Life, Heart of Existence, Universal Breath, aiming to deconstruct the patriarchal image of God. All human beings are equal and deserve respect and dignity. Diversity is celebrated, and each individual is valued. We believe in the richness of exchanges between those who believe in astrology and those who follow a prophet, emphasizing love and interconnection. We are all a common light, illuminating our path towards mutual understanding and compassion.

We uphold freedom of conscience, allowing each person to follow their own spiritual path as long as it does not harm others. We advocate for transparency and collective participation in our decision-making processes, ensuring total inclusion. We act with kindness and compassion, rejecting all forms of violence and promoting a harmonious environment. We recognize the importance of protecting our planet and adopt sustainable and environmentally respectful practices.

Education and knowledge sharing are at the heart of our commitment, fostering collective growth and personal development. The arts are valued as a means of personal expression and spiritual connection, while humor and self-irony are essential for maintaining spiritual and emotional balance. We balance spiritual contemplation with benevolent actions for the collective good. We aspire to a better world, filled with love, and to create a strong sense of community that is currently lacking.

Our system evolves over time, integrating technological and scientific advances to remain relevant and accessible. We believe that our principles and laws must evolve to adapt to contemporary realities while staying true to our fundamental values. We invite you to explore this vision with us, to contribute to a more united, inclusive, and benevolent world, but above all, to help evolve this movement by proposing a better version of this manifesto.

## [Core Principles](/en/PRINCIPLES.md)

Unitas is built on several essential pillars:
- **Unity and Equality:** Every individual is treated with dignity and respect.
- **Freedom of Conscience:** Everyone follows their own spiritual and moral convictions.
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** The richness of experiences and beliefs is valued.
- **Transparency and Participation:** Decisions are made collectively, with clarity and openness.

## Structure of Unitas

Unitas is composed of various levels of community groups, each playing a crucial role in cohesion and collective action.

### [Micro-Swarms](en/microswarms.md)
Micro-swarms are groups of 10-15 people who meet regularly to discuss, reflect, and act. These meetings provide a structured framework for deep and meaningful exchanges, fostering community projects and enriching activities.

### Regional Swarms
Regional swarms group several micro-swarms within the same administrative region, meeting quarterly to share experiences, discuss common issues, and plan coordinated actions. Regional meetings include discussions and conferences on various issues and themes, strengthening spiritual connection and community richness.

### Nests and Hives
Nests consist of regional swarms within a large geographical area or country. Hives are the international structure bringing all nests together, facilitating global coordination.

By uniting micro-swarms, regional swarms, nests, and hives, the community gains strength and cohesion, allowing for more complex and large-scale activities. This union fosters ambitious and structured projects, enhancing the sense of belonging and collective dynamics.

### Transmission of Ideas and Projects
The ability to transmit an idea or project from the individual to the hive via technology is simple, fast, and efficient. Through digital platforms, ideas can be shared, discussed, and voted on at each level, ensuring transparent and participatory coordination with greater reach.

## Inclusive Activities

Unitas offers various activities open to all:
- **Cooking Workshops:** Sharing recipes from around the world.
- **Potluck Meals:** Friendly moments for sharing and discovering.
- **Art and Permaculture Workshops:** Creative and ecological exploration.
- **Technology and Innovation:** 3D printing and robotics workshops.
- **Nature Retreats:** Reconnecting with the environment.

## Transparency and Use of Technology

Unitas places great importance on transparency in all its actions and decisions. To ensure clear and honest management, Unitas uses advanced technologies like blockchain. This maintains a public and immutable record of all expenditures, from micro-swarms to the hive. Every transaction is transparently recorded, including the source and use of donations. This system ensures that all community members can track and verify resource usage, reinforcing trust and integrity within Unitas.

## Conclusion

Unitas is not just a new religion, but a flexible spiritual and community platform aimed at redefining how we approach spirituality and community. By offering micro-swarms for regular meetings, community projects, and philosophical discussions, Unitas provides a dynamic and inclusive framework for exploring and practicing spirituality in a meaningful way.

Unitas is a theoretical exercise, a model of a religion that would meet these needs. It's an invitation to reflect and engage with these topics, without claiming to create an actual religion.
